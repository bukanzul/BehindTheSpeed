<h2> <br> Pro tips on calorie intake <hr> <br> </h2>
       <b>1. Eat More</b>
<p>
<br>
During marathon training you are burning many more calories than you were before, and you need to replace them. 
Looking to lose weight? It may surprise you, but long-distance running is not an effective weight-loss plan.
 One mile of running burns about 100 calories, but that doesnt mean youll lose a pound for every 35 miles you log.
 Many studies show that running increases appetites, especially in new runners. </p>


<b><br>2. Know when to eat</b>
<p><br>When to eat it: Before a race, go for the more digestible, quick sources of carbs for energy, says Elyse Kopecky, a chef and co-author of Run Fast. Eat Slow.
, which she wrote along with the Olympic marathoner Shalane Flanagan. 
Think sugar; this is not the time for whole grain or fiber-enriched foods because theyll sit in your stomach, which means they wont get used like they should,
 and could lead to a race to the Port-a-Potty.
 Thats why instant oatmeal is better before a race instead of steel cut oats.</p>

<b><br>3. Try and Try Again</b>
<p>
<br>Sure, food is fuel, but were not built on an assembly line.
 Your months spent training for a race are there to help you develop your form, your endurance and also your optimal diet.
 Throughout your training, try eating different types of foods and alter their timing little by little to see what works best.
 Then use that combination on race day.</p>

<b><br>4. Watch your carb intake </b>
<p>
<br> Carbs are jet fuel for muscles, says Dr. Jackie Buell, assistant professor of sports nutrition at the Wexner Medical Center at the Ohio State University.
 Your body breaks down carbohydrates to make glucose that is burned in order to move you forward.</p>
